# Tinder2 💌💑

Welcome to Tinder2! This project is a person-matching application built using Prolog. It asks for your name, gender, and preferences, then provides you with a list of potential matches to choose from. Depending on whether you identify as male or female, you'll be shown potential matches of the corresponding gender. Additionally, based on your preferences, you'll see the compatibility percentage between you and each potential match. Once you make a choice, you'll receive a message with your name and the name of your chosen partner, congratulating both of you on your match! 🎉❤️
